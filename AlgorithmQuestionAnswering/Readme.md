Question Algorithm Comparison based on Machine Learning and Non Machine Learning Methods

In this project I will compare real results from open domain data sources such as DBPedia and Wikidata. 

You need to run Stanford Core NLP Server for this purpose. You can install the server in the following link

You can type your question and see the result easily. Have fun

`https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/corenlp-server.html`

Then you should the server with the following command

`Run the server using all jars in the current directory (e.g., the CoreNLP home directory)`

`java -mx4g -cp "*" edu.stanford.nlp.pipeline.StanfordCoreNLPServer -port 9000 -timeout 15000`
